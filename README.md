Xilinx Basys3 demo for how to use openXC7 open-source tools to implement a RISC-V SoC + SW for this classic game, now with a twist.

**Tetris recap**
Most of us know what is Tetris and how it's played, but here is a short introduction for those who don't. Tetris is a game where players maneuver differently shaped pieces called tetrominoes as they descend onto the playing field. The objective is to complete lines by filling them with tetrominoes. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the player earns points. The player can then utilize the cleared spaces to continue playing. The game ends if the lines reach the top of the playing field without being cleared. The longer the player can delay this outcome, the higher their score. In multiplayer games, players compete to outlast their opponents.
